What is an Expression?
------------------------------------
-Most basic building block of a program
-Computes a value from a number of operands
-Examples
    - 34 value is equal to 34    //literal
    - favorite_number            //variable
    - 1.5 + 2.8                  //addition
    - 2 * 5                      //multiplication
    - a > b                      //relational
    - a = b                      //assignment

What is a Statement?
------------------------------------
-A complete line of code that performs some action
-Usually terminated with a semicolon
-Examples
    - int x;                                  //declaration
    - favorite_number = 12                    //assignment
    - 1.5 * 2.8;                              //expression
    - x = 2 * 5                               //assignment
    -if (a > b) cout << "a is great than b"   //if
